# GoBike Data Exploration


## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
It consists of 183412 records. this is information is only for Feb month in the 2019 year. it contains bike ID, duration trip, start station, and other information. 



## Summary of Findings

In the exploration,
I found that Male has a bigger ratio, the reason for that is still not very clear as it could be related to the population of this city and proportion of male to female.
Also, it was very clear that the subscriber user is more than customer users,
In addition to that I found that the weekends days are the lowest days in bike usage,
I was suspected that the users tend to use bikes for work and it may view become more clear one I saw the hourly usage of bikes,
The peake was from 8 AM to 9 AM and from 5 PM to 6 PM which gives me more confidence that users are employees. 

In terms of users' age, I found that most users fall in around 30s.

Also, I found a nice relation between age and the duration of the trip.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on providing charts with answeres for some direct question which will help the marketing team, I start by asking "What is the most gender riding our bikes?" and the answer was "Male has a bigger ratio" however I gave some hint that it could be the higher proportion of male in this city.

I followed that by another question "Should we focus on a subscriber or regular users in our customer retention program?", the answer was very clear that we Should focus on subscriber users in our customer retention program and I provided a chart that depicts that. 

There was a question related to the weekdays have most bike operation, I showed that by a chart that depicts weekends has lower bike operation. 

Afterward, I provided more question with their answers and charts
